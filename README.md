## About

This is a seed project that allows to run Spring Boot AND Vue applicationS at AWS EC2 (accessed by IP or domain) with a
minimal setup required.

Spring Boot application is written in Kotlin. For builds, it uses gradle with plugins: kotlinter, ben-manes.versions and
test-fixtures. Testcontainers is used to test database setup. Spring Security has configured CORS and Basic
authentication - *basing on requirements, should be changed to other authentication method ex. JWT*

Deployment process:

1. Ansible configures EC2
1. Ansible builds Spring Boot and Vue application
1. Ansible builds docker images and pushes them to AWS ECR
1. Ansible starts docker containers on EC2
1. All services (spring boot, vue, mongo) runs on a single EC2 instance.
1. Traefik is used as loadbalancer, to route https requests to required containers by domain name.

That's how the application looks like in a browser. When page is opened it sends request to BE to verify connection.
Additionally, if domain and SMTP server is configured, email can be sent.

## Prerequisites

### Before you start, install at your machine

1. JDK 8+
1. Docker
1. docker-compose
1. Ansible
1. NPM
1. pip3
   > sudo apt install python3-pip
1. boto3 - required to operate with AWS EC2 and ECR
   > pip3 install boto3
1. AWS CLI2
   > https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html

### Additional setup required

1. Create group docker
   > sudo groupadd docker
1. Add currently logged user to docker group
   > sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
1. Logout and Login
1. Verify that user is added to docker group
   > groups | grep docker

## Running on localhost

### Run for development purposes

Use your favourite IDE to start application or execute commands in console

1. Run mongo service and verify you can log in to mongo shell:
   > mongo localhost:27017
1. Run Spring Application
   > ./gradlew -p seed-spring bootRun
1. Run Vue Application
   > npm install --prefix seed-vue<br>
   npm run --prefix seed-vue serve

As a result, you should be able to open application at `localhost:8081` <br>
Request to BE should succeed, it means no errors are displayed, and your local IP with timestamp is displayed.

![Local IP with timestamp - run on localhost](./readme/local-app.png "Local IP with timestamp - run on localhost")

### Run docker containers locally

*Note: Make sure that mongo service is stopped, to allow run docker mongo container*

To run docker containers locally, just execute script:
> sh run-seed-local.sh

Scripts `run-seed-local.sh` builds Spring Boot and Vue applications, builds images and runs them.<br>
When script is executed, verify that everything works as expected
> `docker ps | grep seed `

Verify that three containers are up and running:<br>
*seed-spring-vue-aws_seed-vue*, *seed-spring-vue-aws_seed-spring*, *mongo*

As a result, you should also be able to open application at `localhost:8081` <br>
Request to BE should succeed, it means no errors are displayed, and your local IP with timestamp is displayed.

## Setup required for EC2

If you want to make your application available online, you can deploy it to AWS EC2. This requires minimal
configuration, described below.

**Note: All docker containers (Spring Boot, Vue, Mongo) will be run on single EC2 instance. It is not recommended for
production applications, but it is enough for fast prototyping**

### Setup EC2

Two access modes to your application deployed on EC2 are available:

1. [Elastic IP address assigned to EC2 instance](#elastic-ip-address-assigned-to-ec2-instance)
1. [Domain assigned to EC2 instance](#domain-assigned-to-EC2-instance)

You can decide how to access your application later. For now, some **AWS setup is required**

1. Log in to AWS management console *(create account if you don't have one)*
1. Select region *(it will be used later in configuration file)*
1. Create new EC2 instance *(ex.: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS 64-bit (x86), t2.micro)*<br>
   Note: *Select instance with option: Free tier eligible. It means 750 hours each month per year<br>
   Read more about [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/). Monitor your spendings in AWS console.*
1. For sake of seed project, use default configuration of EC2 instance
1. When prompted, select existing or create new key pair. Save it to *~/workspace/secret/seed.pem*
   *(It will be required to log-in with ssh to EC2 instance)*
1. Create Elastic IP address and associate it with EC2 instance *(it will be used later in configuration file)*
1. Verify that EC2 is up and running. Connect to ECnally, configure Security Group2 using ssh
   > ssh -i ~/workspace/secret/seed.pem ubuntu@[ELASTIC-IP-HERE]
1. Additionally, configure Security Group assigned to launched EC2.<br>
   Enable Inbound Rules:
    - HTTP 443 *expose https port - required only if you want to access your application using domain*<br>
    - TCP 8080 *temporarily expose port for Spring Boot application*<br>
    - TCP 8081 *temporarily expose port for Vue application*<br>
    - TCP 8082 - only for your IP - *expose port for revers proxy - required only if you want to access your application
      using domain*<br>
    - TCP 8083 - only for your IP - *expose port for Spring Boot Actuator where you can monitor your application*<br>

That's how it should look like in AWS:

![EC2 Security Group Inbound Rules](./readme/inbound-rules.png "EC2 Security Group Inbound Rules")

### Setup ansible

1. Add entry to the end of the file: `/etc/ansible/hosts`:

> [ec2-seed]<br>
89.187.123.456 ansible_user=ubuntu<br>

Note: *replace IP address with your Elastic IP*

___

## Elastic IP address assigned to EC2 instance

#### Create configuration file for ansible

File `pb-config.yml` is a template for ansible configuration. Copy this file to your home
directory:<br> `~/workspace/secret/env-ip/pb-config.yml` Note: *Path with env-ip is important here, it is used by
ansible*

Replace 'changeme' values with your account details.

> aws_access_key_id: "changeme"         # format: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"<br>
aws_secret_access_key: "changeme"     # format: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa+aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"<br>
aws_region: "changeme"                # format: "cn-location-1"<br>
aws_account_id: "changeme"            # format: "000000000000"<br>
cors_allowed_origin: "changeme"       # format: "http://89.187.123.456:8081" or https://yourdomain.com
vue_app_api_address: "changeme"       # format: "http://89.187.123.456:8080" - your Elastic IP<br>
vue_app_basicAuthUsername: "changeme" # Used to authenticate request using basic authentication<br>
vue_app_basicAuthPassword: "changeme" # Used to authenticate request using basic authentication<br>

**Important Note:** **Do not store your account details in template file or any other file in git repository. If you
push your secrets to public repository, your account will be compromised, github will detect it and AWS will block your
account**

#### Configure EC2 instance

> ansible-playbook playbook-ec2-configure.yml --private-key ~/workspace/secret/seed.pem --extra-vars "seed_hosts=ec2-dev"

#### Build docker images and push them to ECR

> ansible-playbook playbook-push.yml --extra-vars "seed_env=env-ip version_tag=1.0.0"

#### Run docker images on EC2

> ansible-playbook playbook-run.yml --private-key ~/workspace/secret/seed.pem --extra-vars "seed_env=env-ip seed_hosts=ec2-seed db_setup=false"

Note: *Set `db_setup=true` for first run or if you want to reset database. Otherwise, use `db_setup=false`*

#### Verify application running

1. Log in to EC2
   > ssh -i ~/workspace/secret/seed.pem ubuntu@89.187.123.456 Note: replace ip address with your Elastic IP

1. When logged in, verify that docker images (`seed-vue`, `seed-vue`, `seed-mongo`) are up and running.
   > docker ps
1. Open application in a browser: http://89.187.123.456:8081 Note: *replace ip address with your Elastic IP*

Note: *Configuration of EC2 instance is required only for first time. For consecutive deploys, script '
run-redeploy-ip.sh' can be used - it runs `playbook-push.yml` and `playbook-run.yml`*
___

## Domain assigned to EC2 instance

#### Domain setup

1. If you don't own a domain, you can buy one.<br>
   I've selected http://domain.com provider because it was the cheapest one.<br>
   **Important Note:** *Turn off domain auto-renewal if you donâ€™t want to be charged every year - price for renewal is
   usually higher*
1. Create email account - *it will be required when https ca certificates will be generated*
1. Create cloudflare account https://www.cloudflare.com/ *(free account available)*.<br>
   Log-in and add DNS entries for your domain. Replace CNAME record with your own domain.
   ![Cloudflare dns setup](./readme/dns.png "Cloudflare dns setup")
1. Allow cloudflare to manage your DNS. Cloudflare provides detailed instruction how to do this, like below
   ![Cloudflare domain management](./readme/cf-manage.png "Cloudflare domain management")
1. Point to cloudflare nameservers, at domain.com it can be done like below:
   ![Point to cloudflare nameservers](./readme/domain.png "Point to cloudflare nameservers")
1. In cloudflare enable http to https redirection and select option to always use https

Note: *If you're done, you need to wait even up to 24h (usually it is faster), for changes to take effect.*

#### SMTP config for emails

Create mailgun account if you don't have one. Note: *phone number verification is required*. For development purposes,
mailgun offers free plan - emails to 5 verified email addresses can be sent. No domain configuration is required for
free plan, because sandbox environment is used.

From menu: *Sending >Domains* select your sandbox domain, select *SMTP* option, and get your credentials. Value  *
Username* will be used to set *seed_mail_username* and *Default password* will be used to set *seed_mail_password*
in *pb-config.yml*
Other values are configured in *application.yml* and doesn't have to be changed.

![SMTP configuration](./readme/smtp.png "SMTP configuration")

The paid plan may be used if needed, but it requires additional domain configuration. Mailgun provides simple and
detailed instruction how to do this, and it is not in the scope of this seed project.

#### Create configuration file for ansible

File `pb-config.yml` is a template for ansible configuration. Copy this file to your home
directory: `~/workspace/secret/env-domain/pb-config.yml` Note: *Path with env-domain is important here, it is used by
ansible*

Replace 'changeme' values with your account details. Bold text shows values that has to be changed comparing to
configuration required to access application only by IP.

> aws_access_key_id: "changeme"       # format: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"<br>
aws_secret_access_key: "changeme"     # format: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa+aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"<br>
aws_region: "changeme"                # format: "cn-location-1"<br>
aws_account_id: "changeme"            # format: "000000000000"<br>
**cors_allowed_origin: "changeme"     # format: "https://yourdomain.com"<br>
vue_app_api_address: "changeme"       # format: "https://api.yourdomain.com" - your domain prefixed with api subdomain**<br>
vue_app_basicAuthUsername: "changeme" # Used to authenticate request using basic authentication<br>
vue_app_basicAuthPassword: "changeme" # Used to authenticate request using basic authentication<br><br>
**seed_mail_username: "changeme"      # Set if you want to enable email sending - Read more in section: [SMTP config for emails](#smtp-config-for-emails)<br>
seed_mail_password: "changeme"        # Set if you want to enable email sending - Read more in section: [SMTP config for emails](#smtp-config-for-emails)<br>
traefik_host: "traefik.changeme"      # format: "traefik.yourdomain.com"<br>
api_host: "api.changeme"              # format: "api.yourdomain.com"<br>
ui_host: "changeme"                   # format: "yourdomain.com"
issuer_email: "changeme@yourdomain.com"**

**Important Note:** **Do not store your account details in template file or any other file in git repository. If you
push your secrets to public repository, your account will be compromised, github will detect it and AWS will block your
account**

#### Build docker images and push them to ECR

> ansible-playbook playbook-push.yml --extra-vars "seed_env=env-domain version_tag=1.0.0"

#### Run docker images on EC2

> ansible-playbook playbook-run.yml --private-key ~/workspace/secret/seed.pem --extra-vars "seed_env=env-domain seed_hosts=ec2-seed db_setup=false"

Note: *Set `db_setup=true` for first run or if you want to reset database. Otherwise, use `db_setup=false`*

#### Verify application running

1. Log in to EC2
   > ssh -i ~/workspace/secret/seed.pem ubuntu@89.187.123.456 Note: replace ip address with your Elastic IP

1. When logged in, verify that docker images (`seed-vue`, `seed-vue`, `seed-mongo`) are up and running.
   > docker ps
1. Open application in a browser: http://yourdomain.com Note:

Note: *Configuration of EC2 instance is required only for first time. For consecutive deploys, script '
run-redeploy-domain.sh' can be used - it runs `playbook-push.yml` and `playbook-run.yml`*

#### Note: after everything, block ports 8080,8081 - make them available only from your IP

## Troubleshooting

Note: For development purposes, in `playbook-run.yml` uncomment acme-staging ca server, as shown below:
> "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.caserver=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"

To generate certificate once again, remove old one and run `playbook-run.ym` once again. See traefik logs:
> docker logs seed-traefik

If everything works fine - no errors should be displayed
> sudo rm /home/ubuntu/letsencrypt/acme.json
